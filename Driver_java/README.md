# MockRobot Driver
# Java implementation

## Details (including reasons for each desicion)

### 1. **Development tools:**

- *Eclipse* used to write the Java code, including tests.
- *VS* used to write documentation.
- *draw.io* used to make diagrams
- *pen and paper* used to write ideas and multiple diagrams before converting to digital form 

### 2. **Language:** 
- *java 8* used because it is one of the new releases and is supported universaly 
### 3. **Test framework:** 
- *JUnit 5* was tought to me at uni and I dont know of a better way for testing. Hope to learn different frameworks for different languages. 


## Not Doing
- **any tests** Some tests were written but the classes have too much coupling so they cannot be tested separately. 
- **Personalized Exceptions for every case** A couple exceptions were created but I would make more if I were to test all the application. 
- **Main class does NOT compile** There is a lot of errors in the program due to the lack of a  Robot to connect to.

# Methods 

All methods are commented explainig the use and response. 
I will be happy to write all of them here is necesary. 

Please see [Flow Charts]() For a more illustrative version of some of the pseudocode.
